## Description

Originally from Cincinnati, I've been in Aichi, Japan since 2004 (not counting a 1
year stint back home from mid-2005 to mid-2006). I was an English teach for
quite a while here and after discovering my interest in programming, I left the
easy-going life of an English teacher in Japan for the soul-crushing life of a
web (developer/designer/director). I've worn a lot of hats here. I've been to
the belly of the Japanese salaryman beast and it's fucking horrifying.
Thankfully, I escaped to a much nicer place (now) and I'm getting a chance to
spread my designer-y wings.

## Projects

My first big open-source project was my scripting library for OminFocus. I've built a bunch of [Gridsome][] and [Tailwind][]-related projects over the last
couple years as well. I'm more into React these days, so my future plans are to
start sharing some of the little React libraries I've built for my own projects
lately and contribute to some Next.js plugins I use.

## Future

I'm currently working on two side projects. One is a digital survival kit for
traveling to or living in Japan called JapanKit. The other is a podcast about
being fussy about things, title Fussy Show.

If you've found any of my open-source work helpful, please consider supporting
me on Buy Me a Coffee. Drop me a line on [Twitter][] or shoot me an email (blp at
hey dot com).
