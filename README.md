## About Me

Originally from Cincinnati, I've been in Aichi, Japan since 2004 (not counting a 1
year stint back home from mid-2005 to mid-2006). I was an English teacher for
quite a while here and after discovering my interest in programming, I left the
easy-going life of an English teacher in Japan for the soul-crushing life of a
web (developer/designer/director). I've worn a lot of hats here.

I'm married to a wonderful woman and have a 6 month old son. I train Brazilian
jiu-jitsu and I'm a traditional Stoic.

## Things I've Made

My first big open-source project was my scripting library for OminFocus. I've
built a bunch of [Gridsome][] and [Tailwind][]-related projects over the last
couple years as well. I'm more into React these days, so my future plans are to
start sharing some of the little React libraries I've built for my own projects
lately and contribute to some Next.js plugins I use.

## Current Obsession

I'm super into [Remix][] and [Astro][] right now. I love it because it encourages you to use
standard Web APIs and model your communication with the server as
tried-and-true form submissions.
