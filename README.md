  Welcome to my little corner of the Internet! This site is an attempt to get
  back to where we used to be in the 90'sâ€”everyone having their own personal
  site that told the world who they are and what they're interested in.

  My name is Brandon Pittman. I build web sites and apps, study
  <a href="https://traditionalstoicism.com/the-path-of-the-prokopton/"
    >traditional Stoicism</a
  >, and I train Brazilian jiu-jitsu. I sometimes
  <a href="https://brandonpittman.com/notes">write</a> about programming, Stoic ideals, and managing time
  and attention. I don't use social media aside from
  <a href="https://github.com/brandonpittman">GitHub</a>
  or
  <a href="https://dribbble.com/pittman">Dribbble</a>. My backstory is on the
  <a href="https://brandonpittman.com/about">About</a> page. If you're interested in what I'm
  <a href="https://brandonpittman.com/unread">reading</a> or <a href="https://brandonpittman.com/unplayed">playing</a>, those lists
  are available too.

  If you'd like to help support my continued work on open source software, or
  you'd like to say "thanks" for something of mine that you used or read that
  gave you some benefit, then consider
